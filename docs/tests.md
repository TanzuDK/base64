# Tests

You must have Docker installed, and be able to run [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), to run the application locally.


Runing 

```make build``` 

Builds the containers.


Running 

```make up``` 

runs the application, and it's avaliable at http://localhost:8080 for the frontend, and http://localhost:8000/docs for the backend swagger interface.

Run `CTRL + c` to exit out of the app.

Runing 

```make down``` 

cleans up the deployment.
